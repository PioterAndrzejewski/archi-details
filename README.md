## 🤔 **What is this project all about and what needs does it solve?**

There is no modern, interesting source of architectural details on the Polish Internet for architects. Materials are often uploaded only by manufacturers, and users can only search and download them. The content is mixed up and poorly described, making it extremely difficult to find exactly what you need. And even when one does find the right detail, there is no assurance that the solution is a good one.

* The application will only focus on architectural details. 
* Uploaded details will be "easy to find" (filtering of material by a multi-stage selection of filters on images.
* Materials will be able to be evaluated and commented on. This way in the comments there can be information about potential mistakes / things to think about in the detail before applying to the project.
* Each item will include a name, such, downloads (dwg and pdf) and ratings and comments.
